## Update information

This version is a major update as well as a change in maintainer. The
original aoristic package was submitted by Dr. George Kikuchi, then at
Fresno State University. He now works as an analyst manager for the
Philadelphia Police Department. He hasn’t had time to maintain or update
the package since 2015. I am the originator of the aoristic method and
I’m taking over the maintenance of the package, with his blessing and
approval. Assuming you want to check with him, his new email address is:
<george.kikuchi@phila.gov>

My email address for maintainer purposes is: <jhr@temple.edu>

## Changes

There are major changes, because the old code from 5+ years ago has been
rewritten and updated. New functionality has been added and most of the
old functions have been discontinued. To gauge any potential impact, I
tweeted a warning about the package to crime analysis networks and
\#RStats. I received a single reply, and confirmed with the replier that
the functionality he needed was available in the new release.

## Submission version

Please note that although this is not a new submission for ‘aoristic’,
it is my first submission as a submitter/maintainer.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Dependencies

I ran devtools::revdep() on the package and it returned character(0)
which I assume means there are no downstream dependencies.
