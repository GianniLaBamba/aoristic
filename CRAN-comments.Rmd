## Update information

Minor tweak to address impact of changes to POSIXlt in email from Martin Maechler a couple of weeks ago. The changes throw errors during time interval calculations. This update fixes the issue for this package.  

My email address for maintainer purposes is: jhr@temple.edu

## Changes

Slightly modified code in 'aoristic.datacheck' and 'aoristic.df'. 


## Submission version

Version 1.1.1. 


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 
The single NOTE relates to a possible bug in R-hub: https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503
 

## Test environments 
Tested on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran, Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC

## Dependencies
I ran devtools::revdep() on the package and it returned character(0).
